## Paper Title

**Conference**: [Brazilian Symposium on Computer Games and Digital Entertainment (SBGames)](https://www.sbgames.org/sbgames2020/)

### Folders

#### Logs

Full training logs of the agents in all experiments.

#### Scenarios

**Animated**: custom scenario with animated walls, ceiling, and floor.  
**Basic**: standard *Basic* scenario from [VizDoom](http://vizdoom.cs.put.edu.pl/).  
**Caco**: custom scenario with the original Cacodemon monster skin.  
**Flat**: custom scenario with only flat textures.

### Trained Models

You can find the four trained agents in [this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UdxsbmW30HjFtkd2eVxC34UWBHghH5Xd?usp=sharing).  
To load a model, extract the files then use the Keras command [load_model](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/models/load_model).
